 Fairness Perceptions
 ^^^

In collaboration with [Malik Boykin's lab](https://www.boykinlab.com/) in Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences at Brown, we are studying people's preferred definition of fairness and what social and algorithmic factors influence these preferences. To power these tools, we are also developing techniques to interpolate between definitions of fairness.

In this project, we examine how fairness can be evaluated at the task and problem level in order to develop heuristics for the feasibility of a fair model prior to training.
