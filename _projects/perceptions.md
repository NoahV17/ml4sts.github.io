In collaboration with [Malik Boykin's lab](https://www.boykinlab.com/) in Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences at Brown, we are building tools to help understand people's preferred definition of fairness and what social and algorithmic factors influence preferences. To power these tools, we are also developing techniques to interpolate between definitions of fairness.
